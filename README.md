## Introduction

This was the weekend challenge following week 5 of the Makers Academy course, to build a scorecard application for ten-pin bowling. The full spec for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/peterwdj/bowling-challenge/blob/master/instructions.md).  

**This project is currently incomplete.**

As things stand, the application can handle all frames save the final, 10th frame, and consecutive spares and strikes.


## Running the App

This project is incomplete and not yet able to be properly run.


## Approach

My initial approach to this challenge was severely flawed, marked by a lack of proper planning and a lack of recognition of the complexity of bowling. After creating a mess of code which did not properly scale, I decided to start again from scratch. When rewriting the code, I began by diagramming out in detail (on paper) all possible different permutations within a game of ten-pin bowling, and writing out (again on paper) pseudo-code for how this could implemented with JavaScript. I am yet to translate this pseudo-code into real code. 


## Challenges

The primary challenge associated with building this application was the deceptively complex logic involved in the game of ten-pin bowling (we were [warned](https://github.com/peterwdj/bowling-challenge/blob/master/instructions.md), to be fair...). This resulted in the aforementioned rewrite. Despite JavaScript still being a new language, and still becoming accustomed to its design patterns, the fundamentals of creating tested and functioning code did not prove particularly problematic.


## Tech Stack

This is a simple application that uses only JavaScript (with jQuery and the Jasmine testing framework) and HTML/CSS.
